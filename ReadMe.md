The Raindrops Game is played by moving a catcher at the bottom of the screen that catcher the raindrops that fall from the top. There are four difficultie: each difficulty has a corresponding speed at which the raindrops fall. There are three lives; if you lose all three lives, game over!

Bugs and oops:

I don't even know what I pressed in Github, but I think it reverted my program to an earlier copy without lives and a game over screen. ACK IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I'll just bring my back-up (which I made this time, luckily) to school tomorrow. 

Actual bug: When you press the mouse on the game over screen stuff pops back up and the game keeps playing in a glitchy manner. Just don't press the mouse on the game over screen.
