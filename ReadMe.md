The Raindrops Game is played by moving a catcher at the bottom of the screen that catcher the raindrops that fall from the top. There are four difficultie: each difficulty has a corresponding speed at which the raindrops fall. There are three lives; if you lose all three lives, game over!

Bugs and oops:

I don't even know what I pressed in Github, but I think it reverted my program to an earlier copy without lives and a game over screen. I cannot for the life of me remember how I did it, and now my lives basically don't work. Rather than add this to the master branch, I have added it to the Lives and Game Over branch. 
The problem with the lives is that I can't remember what I did to work around an issue the first time, so when one life is lost the others follow very quickly. Something to do with the height of the raindrop, but I can't fix it now. I suppose it's better to keep my working copy committed to the master branch. If I can get some help finding my old copy of the game with working lives it would be greatly appreciated.
